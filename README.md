In a nutshell:
VK-bot, based on python vk_api library. 
It reports to subscribed users about extremely low 
atmosphere's temperature, redirects city's government's
edicts about school lessons.

Lyric part:
Russia is a big country. Siberia is part of Russia.
It's cold in Russia. But you don't really know,
how cold it is in siberia. It's much more colder,
than anywhere else. 

Sometimes temperature falls up to 50Â°C. It's dangerous for
people to stay outside then. So it's prohibited by
government to go to school on such cold days. These
days are called "aktirovki".

But how can schoolboys know - when they must stay 
at home and when they must go to school? Ask parents?
Google?

Ow, it's so tediously. Maybe there's another way?

I've searched for it and created this bot, which 
reports to VK group subscribers real state of affairs.

Questions:

Why VK? - VK is the most popular social network
among Russian schoolboys, so I preferred it to all other
networks.
